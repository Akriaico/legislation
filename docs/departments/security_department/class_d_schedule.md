## Schedule

| Schedule       | Time Duration      | Duties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SLEEP**      | **00:00 to 03:00** | Every cell in the cell block will close automatically. Security personnel are to direct Class D stragglers inside their cells. Termination should only occur if they show disobedience or do not respond in 5 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **FREE TIME**  | **03:00 to 09:00** | Class D are allowed to roam freely inside their containment zone. Security personnel should follow normal procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **LUNCH**      | **09:00 to 14:00** | Lunch time currently does not require any additional procedures for Security personnel to perform. It can be seen the same as Free Time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **ACTIVITIES** | **14:00 to 17:00** | The Activities Center area opens. Security personnel should follow normal procedures, however it is recommended that at least 1 Security member is stationed inside the Activities Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **CHECKUPS**   | **17:00 to 21:45** | Medical Department members are allowed inside the CDC to check on the Class Dâ€™s health. Only Medical Department members ranking Nurse and above can enter the CDC during this time. Security personnel may order the Medical Department members to leave the inner CDC at any time for any reason. This is not to be abused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **LOCKUP**     | **21:45 to 00:00** | The termination line is to be moved in the inner CDC (Depicted below). After all Class D have moved behind the inner termination line, the doors and gates that lead to it are to be closed. Make sure there are no Class D in the mines, then close them. Do not immediately terminate Class D who aren't behind the inner termination line once LOCKUP is called, instead tell them to do so and only terminate if they refuse to cooperate. During LOCKUP, Security personnel should verbally direct Class D into the cells for the SLEEP period, but should not use any type of force while doing so. ![](./images/CD_Courtyard.png) |

:::caution
Mines are to be **closed** during the lockup and sleep periods. Otherwise, it must be open at **all times.**
