title: Emergency Recontainment
---

The emergency recontainment system is a recontainment hierarchy that gets activated by a;
Crimson-9 Specialist and above. When activated, the new hierarchy is in effect and Crimson-9 will gain authority over all field operatives for a clean recontainment process. Exceptions would be subdivision heads, SC-4 and other Task Force Captains. Having a system like that during a breach, would make things easier to coordinate. When not activated, recontainment Forces are to follow the normal recontainment hierarchy.
The hierarchy is the following:

> **Field Chief/Security Chief > Task Force Captains (All Task Forces) > Crimson-9 Specialist+ > Crimson-9 Agents > Other MTF Agent+ > Subdivision Commanders > Subdivision members\* > Base SD command (Officer+)**

_The SD subdivision hierarchy is SRU > MP._
CM are to never recontain, they are to go to the CDC and further assist there.
