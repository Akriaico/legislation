A containment breach has occured on-site.

- **Base SD** ranking **Junior and below** must station at site Phi and ready the Breach Shelter for use.
- During a containment breach, all combative personnel on-site are required to report to the **Strategic Communications** Voice Channel, within the joint combative server.
  - Do **not order non-combatives** to the Breach Shelter unless the breached SCP is within Site Phi, _or_ the breached SCP is **SCP-106**.

A detailed document regarding these procedures can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tb7L2EcS3SsZxDCd_gFPAAA9OSs8_HT5wqMoApIPwwQ/edit). It is recommended that all Security personnel read throughout this document.

## <Highlight color="#351c75">Purple Reign</Highlight>

A hostile party has begun a raid within the facility. Divisionless SD personnel will be tasked with the defence of Site Phi and its Checkpoint, and they will roam it for better positioning and defence against hostiles. **The Breach Shelter Control Room must be manned at all times during a raid.** During a raid, all combative personnel present on-site are required to **join the joint combative radio** within the joint SD & MTF server in an attempt to cooperate better with each other.

May only be initiated by **Security Class 4+** or **DDA Consul**.

## <Highlight color="#d696bb">Oxygen Depletion</Highlight>

An Oxygen Depletion should only be used as a last resort protocol. All personnel on-site are to report to the Breach Shelter for their own safety. The Breach Shelter doors close a few seconds before the vacuum sounds begin. These sounds signify that the protocol is doing its intended purpose and is almost concluded. Anomalies, Crimson-9 Operatives and the P3MPS suit on E&Ts & SRT are not effected by the protocol.

## <Highlight color="#20124d">Blackout</Highlight>

Protocol Blackout is one of the least-used protocols as the requirements to use such protocol, rarely if ever happens. This protocol should only be used if site security is compromised and is unable to be gained back. This protocol will eliminate all of the power within the facility, representing a pitch-black environment, signifying that the active threat(s) will not be dealt with easily
