## Cadet Orientation

A Cadet Orientation is a special training made specifically for Cadets to undergo the most basic training and prove themselves worthy of ranking up to Junior. Cadet Evaluations usually encompasses guideline questions and knowledge evaluation as well as behavioral and combative education. Security Cadets must pass this training before being able to go on-site on the Security Department team.

## Standard Training

Available for all personnel to attend, a Standard Training aims to practice an individual’s general skills and knowledge. This type of training encompasses guidelines education, protocol familiarity, situational formation awareness, and combat proficiency.

## Combat Training

A training that goes over multiple areas of combat, including PvPs & TDMs. This will help
you enhance your aiming capabilities and hopefully help you get into a future subdivision at some point. Simulations are also held, to better the knowledge of our members and combat skills.

## Joint Departmental Training

A joint departmental training is done alongside Mobile Task Forces personnel and integrates the topics covered in a Combat Training. This type of training is intended to cultivate camaraderie and improve communications between the Security Department and Mobile Task Forces.

## Scenario Training

A training that goes over majority of the scenarios that will come before you in-game. This training will go in-depth as possible explaining the best outcome you could have chosen as per the scenario. This training’s initial purpose is to ensure security department members know the best outcome to said scenario they’re facing, and are well trained with it. Be prepared for what you may not expect, the host may do any scenario he/she deems fit.
