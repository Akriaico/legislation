Verbal warnings are handed out by Security Officers and above. Verbal warnings are given typically by a Security Officer telling someone they’ve violated a rule. These warnings are logged but are generally not considered if the user has no other punishment.

## <Highlight color="#ffc300">Moderate</Highlight> Infraction

When being demoted you will receive a direct message from a Security Inspector or above.

### <Highlight color="#3dae72">Light</Highlight> / <Highlight color="#ffc300">Moderate</Highlight> Infraction - Regulations Re-teaching
