title: Roll Call
---

Roll Call is a unique feature made by the Security Department, and is in no way affiliated with the regular Class-D schedule that is shown on the monitors within CDC. A quick explanation and brief of said feature; when Roll call is called, it should be done within the combative radio by the proper commanding authorities. Members of the Security Department will start sweeping the CDC including the cells, and say “Roll Call!” whilst starting to organize an SFL for all Class-D members, if necessary organize multiple columns of the line.

Class-D who choose to disobey will be zip tied within the line, after 2 strikes they will be zip tied by your side until Roll call ends. The member who called Roll call, will start a head count of all Class-Ds, once done, compare the numbers to how many Class-Ds are online.

If Class-D members are missing, preferably **7+ CD**, a few SD will begin sweeping the site, ensuring to terminate and call out all Class-Ds that are outside of the CDC, roaming the facility. Stay out of restricted areas such as **Site Epsilon** & **Site Alpha**. The Roll call feature should last **no longer than 5 minutes**, it should end once the head count is concluded. Lockdown may be used if necessary, to prevent anarchy. Do not call the feature if Class-Ds are confirmed of escape, rioting or CDC is understaffed of SD.

To activate such feature, the following requisites must be met;

- You must be **Security Sentry** and above;
- **SRU Response Operative** and above;
- **MP Constable** and above;
- **CM Specialized Field Medic** and above; and
- **5+ Class-Ds** are suspected of escape.
