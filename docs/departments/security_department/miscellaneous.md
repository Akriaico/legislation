## Subdivisions

## Divisional Inspectors

The Divisional Inspectors are responsible for providing their oversight among all subdivisions, acting as a overwatch command, ensuring they’re all functioning correctly, and making any necessary changes to the sub-division. They have more authority then the subdivision leaders, although don’t intervene unless absolutely necessary. Do not contact them for matters easily solvable by sub-divisional command.
The Divisional Inspectors may only be the Security Chiefs.
