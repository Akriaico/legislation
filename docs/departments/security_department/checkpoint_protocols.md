---

Members of the Security Department are expected to follow and understand all of the checkpoints and how to control them at all times.

You can find more information regarding checkpoint protocol here:

## Site Epsilon

---

During testing, security personnel are expected to be able to brief Class D personnel. During a brief, the following brief at the Epsilon checkpoint. This brief may only be given if no members of the Mobile Task Forces are able to do so within at least three minutes.
You are required to ask for a member of the Mobile Task Forces over the radio.

After three minutes, if no members of the Mobile Task Forces or Military Police are present, you may brief the escort at the Epsilon checkpoint scanners. Located below is the proper example brief. You are able to customize the brief, however, it must display the same rules as the one used in the example:

> _"Please form a line leading up to the scanner."_

**Note:** Wait until everyone is lined up at the scanner

> _"SCP, CZ?"_

**Note:** You only ask the scientist what SCP or CZ they’re going to.
**Note:** Make sure they’re able to test the SCP they’re trying to test on.

> _"Alright, listen up. Before continuing on you must agree with this brief."_

> _"During this test you must follow all orders from Security, Mobile Task Forces, or the researcher."_ > _"If you have any firearms you may not use them during this test."_

> _"You will move through the scanner one by one on my command."_

> _"If you are armed you must declare it before moving through the scanner, failure to declare if you are armed will result in termination."_

> _"Am I understood?"_

:::info
While inside of Site Epsilon, you must monitor all Class D personnel to ensure none of them are attempting to escape. You are **not permitted** to terminate test subjects unless they are becoming a constant annoyance or disrupting the test.

## Clean Rooms

---

Security Personnel are able to perform the Clean Room brief if no C-9 or Military Police personnel respond within 3 minutes. Security Personnel should only brief and proceed with the test if the test requires no special escorts or other procedures. The Clean Room brief is as follows:

> _“Before continuing with this test you must abide by the following brief.”_

> _“During this test you must follow all orders from MP and MTF personnel.”_

> _“If you are in possession of any firearms, you may not use them during this test.”_

> _“You will move through the scanner one by one on my command.”_

> _“Failure to declare you are armed before passing through will result in termination.”_

> _“Am I understood?”_

After briefing, one must ask each person involved in the test, **one by one**, if they are armed or not. After receiving an answer, make each person pass under the scanner one by one. After everyone has been briefed and scanned, the test may proceed.

## Highway Checkpoints

The checkpoints located around the area are typically managed by the Military Police. Primarily used for monitoring traffic, checking personnel identification, and more.
