---

Members of the Security Department are responsible for escorting tests and checkups conducted by the Scientific and Medical departments.

## SCP Restrictions

During testing, security personnel are to ensure that the researcher is able to test on the thing they’re attempting to test on.

:::tip
An elaborate list of permissions for members of the Scientific Department can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LCPnaGPp6yreXpCyNXiUgbNHPRjPNdEEFLxiTRWgcjE/edit#gid=0)
:::

If a researcher is found to be requesting for a test out of their clearance, the test is to be cancelled and the Class D are to be escorted back into the Class D Cafeteria.

All HCZ test are **Guard and above**, excluding the Military Police.

:::note
**SCP-173** holds a Security Guard and above requirement to escort said test.
:::

## Escorting

When a request for a test is sent via the queue board. (The top request is to be responded first), Security Personnel who will be escorting the test must obtain a Class D, detain them, and bring them into the transfers. Disarm Class D by detaining them using the zipties tool and holding `F + Click` on them.

:::caution
**Make sure the Class D have been disarmed.** Both transfer gates should never be open at the same time.

All Class D should be disarmed to remove them from the testing queue before continuing on & so they don’t ruin the test.
:::

**Security Cadets** may only escort tests when supervised by a _Security Guard_ or above.

Once the Class D are inside the transfer area, they must line up on the lines. Once lined up, they must be given the following brief:

> _“Listen up Class D”_

> _“These are the rules, you are expected to follow them at all times.”_

> _“Do not attempt to escape this test.”_

> _“Do not attempt to breach any SCPs.”_

> _“Obey all orders given to you by myself and the researcher.”_

> _“Do not speak unless spoken to.”_

> _“Am I understood?”_

All Class D are to be briefed before a test may continue.
