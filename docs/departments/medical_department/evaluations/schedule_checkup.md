:::caution
During the Class-D Containment Schedule rotations, there is a part reserved for Medical Staff to host evaluations on Class-D. These evaluations are shorter than Standard Evaluations due to length of the Check-up schedule time. This is restricted to Nurse+ as a part of regulations to enter the Class-D Containment.
