This document was created in order to inform members of the Medical Department of the guidelines and general regulations of the department. All information here is considered law and enforced by the Ethics Committee and the Medical Department command team, as well as any other authorities with the power to do so. 

The Medical Department was created to ensure the welfare and health of our Foundation remains stable. Members of the Medical Department, due to the Foundation's environment, often handle very interesting issues with our personnel health, such as intensive burns, mass trauma, and other contagious diseases.
